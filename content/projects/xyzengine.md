A game engine written in Java using the [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com) game development library.

During my first year studying IT in college, I spent my extra time in the Java Programming lessens developing
a little game engine in Java. It wasn't going to get used for anything special, but just learning about different
rendering techniques and OpenGL was thrilling enough to keep building on it.

The goal was to create a little voxel engine (like minecraft), but with physics and decent graphics in it.
